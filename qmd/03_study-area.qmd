# Study Area Conditions

{{< include ../setup.qmd >}}

The study area for this analysis includes the streets adjacent to the site as well as their intersections. These streets are 1200 South on the north, University Ave. (US-189) on the east, Towne Centre Blvd. on the west, and Towne Centre Dr. on the south. Note that there is existing development between {{< var devname >}} and Towne Centre Dr. All of the intersections in the \acr{TIA} are signalized with the exception of the Town Centre Blvd. / 1200 South intersection, which is stop-controlled. This is shown in @fig-intersections.

## Street Conditions

Detailed information on each street in the study area is provided in the following sections. This information is also summarized in @tbl-streetconfig.

###### 1200 South

1200 South is an \acr{E/W} local road which, at least in the vicinity of the study area, exists only to offer a connection between Towne Centre Bvld. and University Ave. It runs about 350 feet along the north edge of the proposed {{< var devname >}}, and has 3 \acr{EB} lanes and 2 \acr{WB} lanes. The 2 \acr{WB} lanes offer a left- and right-turning movement, respectively (onto Towne Centre Blvd.), and there is no through movement since 1200 South and Towne Centre Bvld. form a T-intersection. The 3 \acr{EB} lanes offer a left, through, and right-turn movement, either onto University Ave. for the turning movements or into a parking lot for the through movement. There is no posted speed limit, and a raised median prevents left turns onto or off of this road. There is also a sidewalk on either side of the road, but there are no bike lanes.

###### University Avenue (US-189)

University Ave. is also designated as US-189, and is a minor arterial running \acr{N/S} through Provo [@utahdepartmentoftransportation2023a]. It is assigned an access category of 5, which is described as "Regional priority---urban importance" [@utahdepartmentoftransportation2023]. University Ave. connects with I-15 roughly 3000 feet south of the study area and has connections to many commercial developments on either side of the road. There are 3 through lanes in both directions in the study area, with 2 additional left- and 1 additional right-turn lanes/bays in both directions at the Towne Centre Dr. intersection and 1 additional left- and right-turn lane/bay each in both directions at the 1200 South intersection. The posted speed limit is 35 mph, and there is a \acr{TWLTL} on this road for the length of the study area. There is also a 10-foot shoulder on the west side of the road, and there are sidewalks on both sides, though the sidewalk on the east is separated from the road by a grassy curb strip, and the sidewalk on the west is not. There are no bike lanes in this corridor, and there is a bus stop that "splits" 1200 South (see @sec-additional-site-information).

###### Towne Centre Boulevard

Towne Centre Blvd. is a local street that circumnavigates the Provo Towne Centre mall. Within the study area this road runs \acr{N/S}, and has 1 \acr{NB} and 2 \acr{SB} through lanes. A \acr{TWLTL} runs the length of this road, though it is broken up by a bus stop located in the center of the road near the southern end of {{< var devname >}}. This bus stop serves the UVX/830X route, which is a BRT route running from the Towne Centre mall to Utah Valley University [@utahdepartmentoftransportation]. The \acr{TWLTL} becomes two \acr{SB} left turn bays at the Towne Centre Dr. intersection, and there is a \acr{NB} free-flow right-turn bay at the same. This road has a posted speed limit of 25 mph. There is a sidewalk on the east side of the road between the bus stop and 1200 South, but there are no bike lanes.

###### Towne Centre Drive

Towne Centre Dr. is an \acr{E/W} road that runs between Towne Centre Blvd. and University Ave., and becomes East Bay Blvd. east of University Ave. There is a posted speed limit of 30 mph, and there is a raised median between Towne Centre Blvd. and University Ave., though the median breaks about midway, allowing a \acr{WB} left turn to access the development to the south. There are 2 left- and 1 right-turn bays at the University Ave. intersection in both directions, and 2 left-turn lanes and a right-turn free-flow lane at the Towne Centre Blvd. intersection. There is a sidewalk on either side of the road, but there are no bike lanes.

### Additional Information {#sec-additional-site-information}

There are several bus stops in the study area, as shown in @fig-busmap. Towne Centre Blvd. is elevated relative to {{< var devname >}}, but there is a staircase next to the bus stop that allows for pedestrian access.

## Adjacent Land Uses

As can be seen in @fig-zoningmap, much of the nearby land is in the same zoning category as {{< var devname >}} (SC3). This is borne out by the actual land use: there are several suburban commercial sites in this area. The most notable of these is the Provo Towne Centre mall to the east, but other locations include a Sam's Club to the west, several fast-food and sit-down restaurants, and multiple small hotels and gas stations. There is a Residence Inn just to the south of {{< var devname >}} (in fact, this development provides a cross access to {{< var devname >}}; see @sec-site-access), and an additional hotel to the south of that. There is also a strip mall to the northeast containing a large home goods store and clothing stores.

## Site Accessibility

University Ave. provides direct access to {{< var devname >}} from I-15, as well as from downtown Provo. This is the most major road with direct access to the site, but several other roads provide access as well. Towne Centre Blvd. has connections to a neighborhood northwest of the site, and East Bay Blvd. provides access to University Ave. near the site from southeast Provo, and has a connection to Springville via Lakeview Pkwy. and I-89.
