# Analysis of Existing Conditions

{{< include ../setup.qmd >}}

The study area contains four intersections: 1200 South / Towne Centre Blvd., a 3-way stop-controlled intersection; 1200 South / University Ave., a 4-way signalized intersection; Towne Centre Dr. / Towne Centre Blvd., a 3-way signalized intersection; and Towne Centre Dr. / University Ave., a 4-way signalized intersection (see @fig-intersections).

Much of the information regarding lane striping and turning movements for these intersections is given in @tbl-streetconfig. It is additionally worth noting that the east leg of the 1200 South / University Ave. intersection is a parking lot access, and the \acr{WB} lane has a designated left-turn lane and a shared right/through lane. For reference, a lane configuration diagram of these intersections is provided in @fig-lanediagram, and timings for the signalized intersections are provided in @sec-apdx-signal-timings.

## Traffic Volumes {#sec-existingtrafficvols}

Traffic turning volume counts were done at the Towne Centre Dr. / University Ave. and Towne Centre Dr. / Towne Center Blvd. intersections from 4:15--6:00 PM on January 24 (Tue) and 25 (Wed), 2023, respectively. Scheduling conflicts and limited personnel necessitated that the counts be performed for only two intersections and on different days. However, for the purposes of this report this is not a significant limitation, due to the limited scope of the assignment. The two days are considered similar enough, and volumes were estimated for the other two intersections based on these counts and historical data.

From these traffic volumes, 4:30--5:30 PM was determined to be the peak hour, with a peak hour factor (PHF) of 0.92. The volumes for this peak hour are presented in @fig-basevolumes.

#| label: fig-basevolumes
#| fig-cap: "Peak hour turning volumes on the studied intersections."

## Level of Service

A \acr{LOS} measure was used to determine the traffic performance of each intersection (and each movement within each intersection). This \acr{LOS} is a measurement of average control delay per vehicle, and bins the amount of delay into groups designated by the letters A--F. These designations differ between signalized and unsignalized intersections, and are provided in the \acr{HCM} [@highway2022]. @tbl-los-intersections summarizes these criteria. This analysis assumes a \acr{LOS} of `D` or better represents acceptable conditions.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-los-intersections
#| tbl-cap: "LOS Criteria for Intersections"

tar_read(los_criteria) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  set_header_labels(los = "LOS\nDesignation", signal = "Signalized", unsignal = "Unsignalized") %>% 
  add_header_row(values = c("LOS\nDesignation", "Average Control Delay (sec/veh)"), colwidths = c(1,2)) %>% 
  merge_v(j = 1, part = "header") %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  align(align = "center", part = "all")
```

The existing level of service was determined based on current traffic volumes [@sec-existingtrafficvols] and signal timings (obtained from \acr{UDOT}), using the Synchro software package [@trafficware2019]. Synchro performs a \acr{LOS} analysis using these and other inputs, including roadway and lane configuration. @fig-losbasenumbers shows the average control delay for each movement and intersection, and @fig-losbaseletters shows the \acr{LOS} of the same. The full results of the Synchro analysis are available in @sec-synchro-ex.

```{r}
#| label: fig-losbasenumbers
#| fig-cap: "Results of existing Synchro LOS analysis for each movement and intersection studied: control delay values."
#| fig-scap: "Existing Synchro LOS results (control delay in seconds per vehicle)."

#| fig-cap: "Results of existing Synchro LOS analysis for each movement and intersection studied: level of service."
#| fig-scap: "Existing Synchro LOS results (level of service)."

knitr::include_graphics("../images/output/traffic_los_base.png")
```

It is unsurprising that the Towne Centre Blvd. intersections perform so well, since the traffic volumes at these intersections are relatively low (see @fig-basevolumes). It also makes sense that the through and right-turn movements on University Ave. perform well, as this is a major arterial and these movements have relatively long phase lengths (see @sec-apdx-signal-timings). The \acr{EB} and \acr{WB} movements at the University Ave. intersections, however, generally perform much worse. This is for the same reason: the phase lengths on these movements are significantly shorter compared to the conflicting phase lengths. However, these movements do not have an enormous impact on the overall intersection delay(s), as the volumes are much lower than those *on* University Ave.

The overall \acr{LOS} is generally good, though there are several movements with worse than \acr{LOS} `D` (generally acceptable conditions) performance. However, these are relatively minor movements, and the intersections themselves perform much better, so this is not too much cause for concern. It is possible that something as simple as a change in signal timings may do much to improve these under-performing movements. However, further analysis into the coordination of signals on University Ave. is warranted before implementing any signal timing changes.

## Transportation Safety

As part of the analysis for this proposed development, a crash analysis was performed for University Ave. near the site. Recent crash data (obtained from \\acr{UDOT} for 2019\--2022) was used, and crashes between mileposts 0.5 and 1.0 were included in the analysis. This includes the intersections of University Ave. with both Towne Center Dr. and 1200 South, as well as the roadway segments between and either side of the intersections. Crashes occurring within `r tar_read(crash_influence_radius)` miles of an intersection are considered as "belonging" to that intersection, and all other crashes are counted on their respective roadway segments.

@eq-intersection-crash-rate gives the crash rate of an intersection, and @eq-segment-crash-rate gives the crash rate of a segment, where `AADT` is average annual daily traffic, `MEV` is million entering vehicles, and `MVMT` is million vehicle-miles traveled. The AADT was provided by \acr{UDOT} for this stretch of University Ave., and is given as `r tar_read(UA_AADT)` vehicles per day.

$$
Crash\ Rate_{Intersection} = \frac{1000000 \times crashes}{365.25 \times years \times AADT}\ \text{crashes per MEV}
$$ {#eq-intersection-crash-rate}

$$
Crash\ Rate_{Segment} = \frac{1000000 \times crashes}{365.25 \times years \times AADT \times length}\; \text{crashes per MVMT}
$$ {#eq-segment-crash-rate}

@tbl-crashes-intersections provides the two intersections and their crash rates, and @tbl-crashes-segments provides the crash rates on each segment of the roadway (as calculated by Equations [-@eq-intersection-crash-rate] and [-@eq-segment-crash-rate]).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-crashes-intersections
#| tbl-cap: "University Ave. Crash Rates (Intersections)"

tar_read(crash_rates) %>% 
  filter(type == "intersection") %>% 
  select(name, mp, n, rate) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  set_header_labels(name = "Intersection", mp = "Milepost", n = "Number of\nCrashes", rate = "Crash Rate\n(per MEV)") %>% 
  colformat_double(j = "rate", digits = 2) %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  align(j = -1, align = "center", part = "all")

```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-crashes-segments
#| tbl-cap: "University Ave. Crash Rates (Segments)"

tar_read(crash_rates) %>% 
  filter(type == "segment") %>% 
  select(name, min, max, length, n, rate) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  set_header_labels(name = "Intersection", min = "Milepost\nStart", max = "Milepost\nEnd", length = "Segment\nLength", n = "Number of\nCrashes", rate = "Crash Rate\n(per MVMT)") %>% 
  colformat_double(j = "rate", digits = 2) %>% 
  colformat_md(j = 1) %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  align(j = -1, align = "center", part = "all")

```

For the purposes of this assignment, the critical crash rate for intersection analysis is assumed to be 2 crashes per MEV, and the critical crash rate for the roadway segment analysis is assumed to be 8 crashes per MVMT. None of the crash rates approach these values, and so this roadway segment is deemed to be safe. However, it is also important to examine the severity of the crashes. @tbl-crash-levels provides the \acr{UDOT} crash severity scale, and @tbl-count-crashes-by-level gives the number and proportion of crashes at each level. From @tbl-count-crashes-by-level it is clear that the vast majority of crashes are \acr{PDO} crashes, with around 10% with confirmed injury and none fatal. This gives further evidence for the safety of the roadway corridor.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-crash-levels
#| tbl-cap: "Crash Severity Levels (UDOT)"

tar_read(crash_severity) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  set_header_labels(level = "Crash Severity\nLevel", type = "Description") %>%
  autofit() %>% 
  align(align = "center", part = "all")
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-count-crashes-by-level
#| tbl-cap: "Crashes By Severity"

tar_read(crash_severity) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  set_header_labels(level = "Crash Severity\nLevel", type = "Description", n = "Number of\nCrashes", pct = "Proportion of\nCrashes") %>% 
  colformat_double(j = "pct", digits = 3) %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  align(align = "center", part = "all")
```
