# Analysis of Existing Conditions

{{< include ../setup.qmd >}}

## Physical Characteristics

The study area contains four intersections: 1200 S / Towne Centre Blvd, a 3-way stop-controlled intersection; 1200 S / University Ave, a 4-way signalized intersection; Towne Centre Dr / Towne Centre Blvd, a 3-way signalized intersection; and Towne Centre Dr / University Ave, a 4-way signalized intersection (see @fig-intersections). 

For reference, a lane configuration diagram is provided in @fig-lane-diagram.

## Traffic Volumes {#sec-existingtrafficvols}

Traffic turning volume counts were done at the Towne Centre Dr / University Ave and Towne Centre Dr / Towne Center Blvd intersections from 4:15--6:00 PM on January 24 (Tue) and 25 (Wed), 2023, respectively. Scheduling conflicts and limited personnel necessitated that the counts be performed for only two intersections and on different days. However, for the purposes of this report this is not a significant limitation, due to the limited scope of the assignment. The two days are considered similar enough, and volumes were estimated for the other two intersections.

From these counts and projections, 4:30--5:30 PM was determined to be the peak hour, with a peak hour factor (PHF) of 0.92. The volumes for this peak hour are presented in @fig-basevolumes.

## Level of Service

A level of service (LOS) measure was used to determine the traffic performance of each intersection (and each movement within each intersection). This LOS is a measurement of average control delay per vehicle, and bins the amount of delay into groups designated by the letters A--F. These designations differ between signalized and unsignalized intersections, and are provided in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) [@highway2022]. @tab-los-signal and @tab-los-unsignal summarize these criteria. This analysis assumes a LOS of `D` or better represents acceptable conditions.

```{r}
#| label: tab-los-signal
#| tbl-cap: "LOS Criteria for Signalized Intersection"

tar_read(los_signal) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  autofit()
```

```{r}
#| label: tab-los-unsignal
#| tbl-cap: "LOS Criteria for Unsignalized Intersection"

tar_read(los_unsignal) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  autofit()
```

The existing level of service was determined based on current traffic volumes [@sec-existingtrafficvols] and signal timings (obtained from UDOT), using the Synchro software package [@trafficware2019]. Synchro performs a LOS analysis using these and other inputs, including roadway and lane configuration. @fig-losbase shows the results of this analysis.
