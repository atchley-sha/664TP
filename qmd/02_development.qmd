# Proposed Development

{{< include ../setup.qmd >}}

This section describes the plans for the development, including site location, land use, zoning information, and the the site plan itself.

## Site Description

The proposed Dream Town development is located in southern Provo, in Utah. The site is located on the west side of University Ave. (US-189), between 1200 South and Towne Centre Dr. This location is just east of the Provo Towne Centre mall, which is a large retail and dining center and a large generator of trips. The location is also near (to the north of) the intersection of I-15 and University Ave. @fig-sitemap shows a map of the site area. Four intersections are included in the analysis:

- 1200 South / Towne Centre Blvd. (\acr{AWSC})
- 1200 South / University Ave. (signalized)
- Towne Centre Dr. / Towne Centre Blvd. (signalized)
- Towne Centre Dr. / University Ave. (signalized)

## Land Use and Zoning Information

The proposed {{< var devname >}} development has two development pads, with one pad containing a sit-down restaurant and the other pad containing a mixed-use office/retail location. The retail location is intended to be a hardware/paint store. @tbl-landuse shows these land uses along with their \acr{ITE} land use codes and respective square footage.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-landuse
#| tbl-cap: "Proposed Land Use and Sizes"

tar_read(land_use) %>% 
  select(pad, landuse, code, sqft) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  set_header_labels(pad = "Development Pad", landuse = "Proposed Land Use", code = "ITE Land Use Code", sqft = "Area (ft^2^)") %>% 
  colformat_md(j = sqft, part = "header") %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  align(align = "center", part = "all") %>% 
  fit_to_width(6)
```

The site area is zoned as SC3, which is a Regional Shopping Center. The primary use of this land is for commercial and service uses to serve needs of people living in an entire region. It is located close to freeways & major arterials for easy access [@provocitycode, Chapter 14.20]. @fig-zoningmap provides a section of the Provo zoning map [@provocityutah2022] with the site location marked.

## Site Plan

@fig-siteplan shows a site plan for the proposed development. Note that Pad C is not included in this analysis, as it has already been developed. This site map is still preliminary, and will be updated in a future draft of this report.
