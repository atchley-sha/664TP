This section describes the plans for the development, including site location, land use, zoning information, and the the site plan itself.

## Site Description

The proposed Dream Town development is located in southern Provo, in Utah. The site is located on the west side of University Avenue (US-189), between 1200 S and Towne Centre Drive. This location is just east of the Provo Towne Centre mall, which is a large retail and dining center and a large generator of trips. The location is also near (to the north of) the intersection of I-15 and University Avenue. @fig-sitemap shows a map of the site area. Four intersections are included in the analysis:

-   1200 S / Towne Centre Blvd. (stop-controlled)

-   Towne Centre Dr. / Towne Centre Blvd. (signalized)

## Land Use and Zoning Information

The proposed {{< var devname >}} development has two development pads, with one pad containing a sit-down restaurant and the other pad containing a mixed-use office/retail location. The retail location is intended to be a hardware/paint store. @tab-landuse shows these land uses along with their ITE land use codes and respective square footage.

```{r}
#| label: tab-landuse
#| tbl-cap: "Proposed Land Use and Sizes"

lu %>% 
  select(pad, landuse, code, sqft) %>% 
  `colnames<-`(c("Development Pad", "Proposed Land Use", "ITE Land Use Code", "Area (sqft)")) %>% 
  flextable() %>%
  autofit()
```

The site area is zoned as SC3???, .... *include zone map*

## Site Plan

@fig-siteplan shows a site plan for the proposed development. Note that Pad C is not included in this analysis, as it has already been developed. This site map is still preliminary, and will be updated in a future draft of this report.
